1. What is the difference in the waveforms from the simulation of the two designs
gray_bin_selected (Design Task 1) and gray_bin_selected_dc (Design Task 2)?
What in your source files causes this difference?

The difference was a stretch of zero in the output corresponding to the high value gray codes. The reason this is
is because in my source file I deleted the high value graycodes and so they defaulted to the when others case - which I set to 0

2. The testbench used in Design Task 2 tells you for which input combinations the outputs were in
error. How could you modify that testbench so that it also tells you what the actual output was and
what it should have been for each output that was incorrect?

I could modify it do tell me what output it should have been by pluging in the expression for what each bit should have been
Ex: 
report "Error for input " & to_string((g3, g2, g1, g0)) & "\r\n" &
" Output was: " & to_string(b) &"\r\n" & 
" Output Should have been: " & 
to_string(g3) & 
to_string((g3 xor g2)) & 
to_string((g3 xor g2) xor g1)) & 
to_string(((g3 xor g2) xor g1) xor g0)))() & "."

3. How could you modify the testbench used in Design Task 2 so that you do not get errors for the
input combinations where you donâ€™t care what the outputs are?

I could reduce the length of the loop from 15 to 11. This cuts off the high value graycodes I do not care about.

4. Compare the HDL Analyst hierarchical view of the design you synthesized for this Laboratory
with the HDL Analyst hierarchical view of your design from Laboratory 3. Are the diagrams
identical? If not, how do they differ? Are they functionally the same? If not, how do they differ
functionally?




5. Compare the pre-fit equations and post-fit equations from ispLEVER Classic for the design you
synthesized for this laboratory with the equations from your design for Laboratory 3. Are the
equations the same? If not, how do they differ?



6. Explain the differences in the output values when input combinations that are not valid inputs
to the decoder are applied to your functional simulation and to your timing simulation. What
determined these output values for each of your designs? If the rotary encoder providing inputs to
your design generates only Gray codes for angles from 0 up to 270 degrees, does the design you
synthesized meet the design requirements?
